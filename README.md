# Valheim Server Backup

The script enabled you to backup your valheim server data, using your Google Drive as the storage medium. If this gains enough traction, I plan to implement additional storage backends (e.g. AWS S3), but I chose Google Drive since it is free and easy to use.

# Setup

This script was written on and intended for a dedicated server running Ubunto 18.04, but should work on any environment that can install Ruby.

The following steps assume that you have **Ruby 3.0.0** or greater installed already!

1. Download the script:

```shell
# TODO: Add download info
```

2. Install bundler and gems
```shell
gem install bundler
bundle install
```
3. TODO: Steps here about adding google drive keys, etc

# Running
Plan to add info on how to run, including how to setup a cron job.
